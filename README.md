**Understanding the Code** - I'll assume the reader is a kid 

This explains the given Python code for building a simple neural network in the most beginner-friendly way. Imagine this code is creating a tiny brain that can look at images of handwritten numbers (like 0–9) and guess which digit it is.

**Step 1: Initialize Parameters (The Brain’s Wires)**

- A brain has connections (weights w) and biases (b).
- We start them with random numbers because the brain doesn’t know anything yet.
- w1 connects input pixels (784 values from a 28×28 image) to the hidden layer (10 neurons).
- w2 connects hidden layer neurons to the output layer (10 neurons, one for each digit 0–9).


**Step 2: Activation Functions (Making the Brain Alive)**

- ReLU works like a switch: it keeps positive numbers and turns negatives into 0.

- Softmax converts raw scores into probabilities that add up to 1.
- Example: [0.1, 0.05, 0.7, 0.15] → “I’m 70% sure it’s a 2”.

**Step 3: Forward Propagation (Thinking Process)**

-Input image X goes through the brain:
1. Input → Hidden Layer (Z1, A1)
2. Hidden Layer → Output Layer (Z2, A2)
-A2 gives the prediction probabilities.

**Step 4: One-Hot Encoding (Correct Answer Format)**

-Instead of saying the answer is just “3”, we write it as:
	3 → [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
-This makes it easier for the brain to compare its guess to the real answer.

**Step 5: Derivative of ReLU (For Learning)**

<img width="442" height="63" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 1 00 56 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cec8455-3e3c-4387-b316-22b81da3863d" />

-When the brain learns, it needs to know how much to change.
	For ReLU:
	Positive → learn (1)
	Negative → don’t learn (0)

**Step 6: Backward Propagation (Correcting Mistakes)**

<img width="689" height="194" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 1 01 15 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5ab2f5f-01d0-430b-b265-7541ce59d457" />

-The brain checks how wrong it was:
	dZ2: Error at output.
	dW2, db2: Fix output layer.
	dZ1: Push error backwards.
	dW1, db1: Fix hidden layer.
 
**This is like saying: “Oops, I thought it was a 7 but it was a 3. Let me tweak my wires.”**

**Step 7: Update Parameters (Learning)**

<img width="745" height="145" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 1 01 25 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc148907-787b-4833-b6b4-197e358db6b5" />

After finding mistakes, the brain updates its wires:
New weight = Old weight – (learning rate × correction)
alpha = how fast it learns.

**Big Picture**
1.Start with random wires.

2.Think (forward pass).

3.Check the real answer.

4.Find mistakes (backward pass).

5.Fix wires a little (update).

6.Repeat many times → the brain learns digits!
